        <p> Australian pop-punk band, 5 Seconds of Summer recently played at the Sunlight Supply Amphitheater on Wednesday. The band put on a great show that anyone can enjoy, even if you aren't a preteen that wants to marry them. Not only does 5 Seconds of Summer play their instruments well, but their interaction and chat with the audience doesn't seem force nor scripted. The group rose to fame after opening up for One Direction in 2013. Although the band opened for a boy band, any of their fans will quickly inform you that they are not a boy band. Unlike popular boy bands that only sing and dance in unison, 5 Seconds of Summer does not. It is undeniable that the group is mainly followed by tweens and teens and tend to lean more towards pop than rock, the band still puts on an impressive show. The band writes and co-writes all of their songs and each member sings on top of playing their own instrument. Unlike a lot of pop groups that have back-up bands, 5 Seconds of Summer carries the show on their own without back-guitarists or any other help. Typically in bands and musical groups, there are stronger members that carry the whole band, this isn't the case with 5SOS. Each member seems to be equally important to their sound and equally popular with their fans. 5 Seconds of Summer has had some harsh critics in the past because people tend to compare them to Green Day and other punk groups. I believe you shouldn't compare any band to another. 5 Seconds of Summer isn't claiming to be the next Green Day, they are a band on their own. Although the group is heavily inspired by Green Day. Yes, the group's songs are mainly catchy pop driven songs, but not many bands can write catchy songs. Otherwise everyone would be on the radio. 5 Seconds of Summer has a knack for writing songs that get stuck in your head, but still have a punk style. I currently believe that 5 Seconds of Summer is going to out live a lot of the fast lasting teeny bopper bands and may even gain a slightly maturer audience. </p>
