          <p>Responsive web design is the best option for any website in 2017.
            Today it is unpredictable how a user will access your website.
            According to CNN, “Mobile devices accounted for 55% of Internet
            usage.”  Responsive design is about flexibility. Since the user
            could be viewing your site from any screen size or browser, your
            website needs to be flexible enough to be viewed on all screens.
            In “Responsive Web Design” by Ethan Marquette, Marquette says that
             there are three ingredients to a responsive design. The three
              ingredients are a flexible grid-based layout, flexible images
               and media queries. Now days it is important that the website
                is mobile friendly. Not only does mobile friendly designs
                 improve the user experience, but it also helps with search
                  engine optimization. Google ranks mobile friendly websites
                   higher than non-mobile friendly sites. Before responsive
                   , an approach to making websites more accessible from
                   different devices was to write different code for each
                    screen size range. This can be an unpractical approach
                     due to the fact that technology is constantly changing.
